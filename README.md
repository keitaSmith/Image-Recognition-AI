# Image Recognition AI

## Introduction
This web application leverages a pre-trained AI model to recognize and predict objects within an uploaded image. Built using React, TensorFlow.js, and modern web technologies, the app provides a user-friendly interface for experimenting with AI-powered image recognition.

## Features
- **Image Upload:** Allows users to upload images directly from their device.
- **AI Predictions:** Utilizes TensorFlow.js to provide real-time predictions about the contents of the uploaded image.
- **Modern UI:** Features a sleek, responsive design with vibrant colors and animations.
- **Mobile-Friendly:** The app is fully responsive, with a layout that adapts to different screen sizes.

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/keitaSmith/image-recognition-ai.git
2. Navigate into the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd image-recognition-ai
3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
4. Run the app locally:
  ```bash
  npm start
```
## Usage
Open the app in your web browser.
Click on the "Upload Image" button and select an image from your device.
The app will display the uploaded image along with a list of predicted objects and their respective confidence scores.

## Technologies Used
React: Frontend framework for building the user interface.
TensorFlow.js: Library for running machine learning models in the browser.
CSS3: For styling and responsive design.
Node.js & npm: For managing dependencies and running the development server.
